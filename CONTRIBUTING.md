# How to set up lise locally?

- To set up lise you need to have Java 17+, IntelliJ, and Maven
- git clone the project
- use any IDE (IntelliJ recommended)
- configure ``` DISCORD_TOKEN ``` for your own bots' Discord token
- configure ``` LICHESS_TOKEN ``` if you also want to run lise on Lichess
- you are ready to run the bot with ``` mvn clean ```
- finally, compile the code ``` mvn compile ```
- Please note you need to follow the same steps as adding Chesslise for your own local bot
- build the project ``` mvn build ```
